# Keep the Light

Hundred thousand years ago people didn’t have fancy houses. Home was the place where you tendered your fireplace to warm you up and fend off dangerous wildlife. Caveman Ude is facing the same issue. His fireplace every night is being attacked by wild rats, wolves, foxes and even bears. Help Ude build barricades and gather resources to protect for his fireplace in order to survive!

# Gameplay

You are in the middle of the map, there is a campfire near you. The campfire gives you experience and restores your health. There is a night and a day time. Enemies are being spawned at night, they attack you. Each night enemy spawn rate increases. You have to keep placing wood into campfire, before it goes dark. When campfire isn't light up, you do not see anything, you do not get experience and your health doesn't restore. You can spawn rocks, traps, buddies (which help you attack enemies).
